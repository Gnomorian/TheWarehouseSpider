crawls through The Warehouse website looking for shoe barcodes

A web crawler I made to look through the warehouse website to find shoe barcodes.

This was because I worked there in the shoe department and I was making an application 
to to document where all my stock was to make my life easier.

This is archived now because i stopped working there so i no longer need it but feel free to copy the code for your own projects.
